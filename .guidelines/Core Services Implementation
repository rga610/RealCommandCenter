# Comprehensive Guide to Developing Core Services for the Real Estate Command Center

## Introduction

The foundation of your Real Estate Command Center (RECC) rests on its core services—the shared infrastructure that supports all modules and tools. By thoroughly developing these services first, you'll create a robust and scalable application architecture that will simplify module development and maintenance.

This guide will walk you through the entire process of developing core services, from initial planning to testing and documentation, with practical code examples and implementation strategies.


### Step 0: Service Identification and Dependency Mapping

Begin by creating a comprehensive map of all core services and their interdependencies. Based on your project files, I've identified these key services:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Clerk integration
   - Permission management
   - Role-based access control

2. **Data Management**
   - Airtable integration
   - Redis caching
   - Data transformation utilities

3. **Media Management**
   - BunnyCDN storage zones
   - Asset processing and optimization
   - Media metadata handling

4. **Communication Services**
   - Email (SendGrid)
   - Notification system
   - Client portal integration

5. **Integration Services**
   - WordPress synchronization
   - Google Calendar/scheduling
   - Document management

Below is a **step-by-step implementation plan** for creating your Core Services, focusing on **what** to build and **how** to connect the pieces without listing out all the code in full. Use these steps as a blueprint to organize and implement your services consistently.

---

## 1. Project Structure & Organization

1. **Create a `lib/core-services` Folder**  
   - This will house each of your service folders (e.g., `auth`, `airtable`, `cache`, `dam`, `email`, `notifications`, etc.).  
   - Keep related utilities (like `bunnyConfig` for DAM or `permissionService` for Auth) in or near these folders.

2. **Create a `types/core-services` Folder**  
   - Store your TypeScript interfaces or type definitions for each service here (e.g., `airtable.ts`, `auth.ts`, `cache.ts`, etc.).  
   - This makes it easier for other parts of the app to consume service methods consistently.
   - If a type is used by multiple services or modules, add it under types/core-services. If it’s specific to a single service, define it in that service’s folder.

3. **Set Up a `service-registry.ts`**  
   - In `lib/core-services/service-registry.ts`, define a class (e.g. `ServiceRegistry`) that:  
     - Keeps track of each service.  
     - Understands dependencies (e.g., Airtable depends on Cache).  
     - Has an `initialize` method that recursively initializes each service’s dependencies.  
     - Provides a `getService` method to retrieve or auto-initialize the requested service.

---

## 2. Service Registry: The Glue Layer

**Goal:** Implement a single place to create, initialize, and retrieve services.

1. **Map Out Dependencies**  
   - In the registry, define an internal mapping of which service depends on which (for instance, `"airtable" -> ["cache"]`).  
   - Consider minimal or no dependencies for the `cache` and `auth` services.  
   - Be sure to list new services like `notifications` if they rely on `airtable` and `cache`.

2. **Initialization Logic**  
   - For each service, call its `initialize()` method if it exists (async or otherwise).  
   - Only create a new instance of a service once its dependencies are fully initialized.

3. **Singleton Export**  
   - Export a single instance (e.g. `export const serviceRegistry = new ServiceRegistry();`).  
   - Optionally create helper functions (like `initializeModuleServices`) that ensure any module can initialize only the services it needs.

---

## 3. Authentication & Authorization Service

**Goal:** Provide user authentication (via Clerk) and permission checks (role-based) in one place.

1. **Create an Interface** (in `types/core-services/auth.ts`)  
   - Define the shape of your `User` object, `UserRole`, `Permission`, etc.

2. **Build the Auth Class** (in `lib/core-services/auth/`)  
   - Integrate with **Clerk** to get user info, session data, etc.  
   - Provide a method like `getCurrentUser()` to retrieve the logged-in user.  
   - Provide a method like `getUserRoles()` to merge roles from Clerk and Airtable (if you track roles in both).

3. **Permission Checks**  
   - Create a small “Permission Service” or utility that:
     - Knows all possible permissions (e.g., `list-properties:create`).  
     - Maps roles to the specific permissions they hold (`ROLE_PERMISSIONS`).  
   - Expose methods such as `hasPermission(permissionKey, userId?)` or `hasModuleAccess(moduleKey, userId?)` to handle your role-based logic.

4. **Middleware or Hooks**  
   - (Optional) Create a function like `protectRoute()` to redirect if unauthorized.  
   - Provide a React hook like `usePermission()` to easily check permissions in components.

## 4. Data Management (Airtable + Cache)

### 4A. Caching (Cache Service)

1. **Decide on a Redis Provider**  
   - We will use Upstash Redis.  
   - Keep the client logic in a dedicated `cacheService.ts`.

2. **Implement a `CacheService` Class**  
   - Methods for `get`, `set`, `del`, `exists`, etc.  
   - Optionally add helper methods for hashes, TTL, etc.  
   - Handle errors gracefully—if Redis is offline, your main app logic should still keep running but skip caching.

### 4B. Airtable Service

1. **Create Airtable Interfaces**  
   - E.g., `AirtableRecord`, `AirtableQueryOptions` to standardize how you query.

2. **Implement `AirtableService`**  
   - In `lib/core-services/airtable/`, create a class with methods for fetching records, creating/updating/deleting, etc.  
   - For each operation (fetch, find, create, update, delete), handle optional caching by calling the **Cache Service**.  
   - On successful create/update/delete, invalidate relevant cache entries so stale data isn’t returned.

3. **Environment Variables**  
   - Store your Airtable API key (`AIRTABLE_PAT`) and base/table IDs (`AIRTABLE_*_BASE_ID`) in `.env`.  
   - Reference them in your service code for easy setup.

---

## 5. DAM (Digital Asset Management)

**Goal:** Upload, store, and manage media (images, documents, etc.) with BunnyCDN and store metadata in Airtable.

1. **BunnyCDN Config**  
   - Put your Bunny Storage credentials (`name` of the zone, `password`, `cdnUrl`) in a helper file (e.g. `bunnyConfig.ts`).  
   - This helper file provides a function to get zone settings. 

2. **DAM Service Class**  
   - `listFiles(zone, folder)`: Lists files in a folder.  
   - `uploadFile(options)`: Uploads a file to the chosen zone and folder, then logs metadata to Airtable.  
   - `deleteFile(zone, path)`: Deletes a file from BunnyCDN and removes the metadata from Airtable.  

3. **Metadata Handling**  
   - When uploading, generate a unique identifier if needed (e.g., short UUID).  
   - Store data (URL, type, size, path, etc.) in an Airtable table specifically for “media assets.”

4. **Optional Transforms**  
   - Keep an optional “transformImage(url, options)” if you use a third-party service to resize images or do advanced transformations.  
   - Start by returning the original URL as a placeholder, to be expanded later if needed.

---

## 6. Email Service

**Goal:** Send emails with SendGrid, log them in Airtable, and optionally retrieve template details from Airtable.

1. **Core Methods**  
   - `sendEmail(options)`: For straightforward email sends (to, from, subject, HTML, etc.).  
   - `sendTemplateEmail(options)`: For using dynamic data with a SendGrid template ID.  
   - Both methods can log results in Airtable if you want a historical record (fields might include `to`, `subject`, `sentAt`, etc.).

2. **Attach Files** (Optional)  
   - If attachments exist, encode them (base64, etc.) and pass them along to SendGrid’s API.

3. **Template Management**  
   - If you store templates in Airtable (e.g., you keep them documented with a “SendGrid Template ID” and custom fields), you can add a method like `getEmailTemplates()` to fetch them.

---

## 7. Notification Service

**Goal:** Provide a central place for in-app alerts and notifications (e.g., “Property updated,” “New lead,” etc.).

1. **Schema in Airtable**  
   - Create a “notifications” table with fields like `User ID`, `Type` (info, success, warning, etc.), `Status` (unread, read), `Priority`, etc.

2. **NotificationService**  
   - `createNotification(options)`: Writes a new notification to Airtable and caches it.  
   - `getUserNotifications(userId, filters)`: Tries cache first; if empty, queries Airtable.  
   - `markAsRead(userId, notificationIds)`: Updates the relevant records in Airtable and the cache.  
   - `deleteNotifications(userId, notificationIds)`: Removes them from Airtable, updates the cache.  
   - `getUnreadCount(userId)`: Quick way to see how many notifications are unread.

3. **Front-End Hooks**  
   - E.g., `useNotifications(userId)` to handle listing, creating, marking as read, etc.  
   - Can incorporate polling (like once every minute) to refresh notifications automatically.

---

## 8. React Hooks & Client Integration

1. **Create a Hook per Service**  
   - `useAuth()`: Loads current user info from the Auth service.  
   - `usePermission(permissionKey)`: Checks if the user can do a specific action.  
   - `useAirtableQuery(baseId, tableId, options)`: Fetch and auto-poll data from Airtable.  
   - `useMedia()`: Upload or delete files (DAM).  
   - `useNotifications(userId)`: Retrieve or create notifications.

2. **Ensure Each Hook**  
   - Calls `serviceRegistry.getService(...)` inside a `useEffect` or function to do the actual work.  
   - Manages `isLoading` and `error` states for your components.

3. **UI Components**  
   - Build small, modular components for typical tasks (e.g., `MediaUploader`, `NotificationCenter`).  
   - Rely on the hooks you created so the components are lightweight—**all logic** remains in the service layer.

---

## 9. Testing & Quality Assurance

1. **Unit Tests**  
   - For each service, create a test file with scenarios covering success, failure, invalid inputs, etc.  
   - Mock out external dependencies (e.g., Redis, Airtable, BunnyCDN, Clerk) so your tests only validate your logic.

2. **Integration Tests**  
   - Pick pairs of services that frequently interact (e.g., Auth + Airtable, DAM + Airtable).  
   - Confirm that data or user info flows properly from one service to the other.

3. **API Tests** (If You Expose HTTP Endpoints)  
   - When you create Next.js route handlers (e.g., `/api/notifications`), test those handlers to ensure they properly invoke the Notification Service and return correct responses.

4. **End-to-End** (Optional)  
   - If you have a stable environment, consider an E2E test using something like Playwright or Cypress to cover real user flows (logging in, uploading a file, creating a notification, etc.).

---

## 10. Documentation Strategy

1. **Dedicated Docs Folder**  
   - Maintain a `docs/` folder in your repo with markdown files describing each service and how to use it.  

2. **Service-Specific README**  
   - Optionally place a short README in each service folder summarizing what it does, environment variables needed, and example usage.

3. **Code Comments**  
   - Inline doc comments in your TypeScript code (especially for public methods) help future developers understand parameters, return values, and usage notes.

---

## 11. Rollout & Maintenance

1. **Incremental Rollout**  
   - Start with the simplest services (e.g., Cache, Auth) and build up to more complex ones (DAM, Email, Notifications).  
   - Gradually integrate them into your front-end pages or modules.

2. **Logging & Error Handling**  
   - Decide on a logging approach (e.g., `console.error`, a logging library).  
   - Handle errors gracefully in each service (log them, possibly surface them in your UI hooks).

3. **Ongoing Maintenance**  
   - Keep your service interfaces stable (i.e., don’t break method signatures) as modules rely on them.  
   - If you need major changes, version the service or coordinate with dependent modules.

---

## Putting It All Together

By following this plan:

- You’ll end up with **loosely coupled** services, each with a clear responsibility.  
- The **Service Registry** ensures everything is initialized in the correct order.  
- The **Cache Service** improves performance by reducing redundant Airtable calls.  
- The **DAM Service** centralizes your media handling with consistent metadata.  
- The **Email & Notification Services** give you a standard approach to communications.  
- **Auth** ensures consistent user/permission checks across the board.  

This high-level plan should help you implement or refine each piece of your core infrastructure in a systematic, maintainable way—without requiring you to rewrite large code samples.
