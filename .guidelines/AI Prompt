- **AI services**: OpenAI
- **Web scraping**: Firecrawl
- **Email Communications**: SendGrid
- **State Management**: React Context and SWR for data fetching

### Naming Conventions

- **Files/Folders**: 
  - Component files: PascalCase.tsx (e.g., `ListingForm.tsx`)
  - Utility files: camelCase.ts (e.g., `airtableService.ts`)
  - Page files: page.tsx (Next.js convention)
  - Layout files: layout.tsx (Next.js convention)
  - Route handlers: route.ts (Next.js convention)
  
- **TypeScript**:
  - Interfaces/Types: PascalCase (e.g., `interface PropertyListing`)
  - Variables/Functions: camelCase (e.g., `const fetchListings`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `const MAX_UPLOADS = 5`)
  
- **CSS/Tailwind**:
  - Custom classes: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `custom-card`)
  - Follow the project's color scheme variables:
    - primary-dark, primary-medium, primary-light
    - accent-gold, accent-gold-light
    - background

### Core Services

All modules should integrate with these core services rather than implementing their own versions:

1. **Digital Asset Management (DAM)** - For media handling
2. **Document Management System** - For secure document storage
3. **Airtable Integration** - For data access
4. **Email Communication (SendGrid)** - For client communications
5. **WordPress Integration** - For website synchronization
6. **Notification Service** - For in-app notifications
7. **Scheduling/Calendar** - For appointments
8. **Analytics/Reporting** - For metrics
9. **Geolocation/Mapping** - For property locations
10. **Client Portal** - For external access
11. **Search/Filtering** - For data discovery
12. **Authentication/Authorization** - Using Clerk and Airtable
13. **AI Agent** - For user assistance

### Module Implementation Pattern

When helping me implement a new module, follow this pattern:

1. **Module Planning** - Help define scope, data model, and flows
2. **Directory Structure** - Set up required folders and files
3. **Parent Module** - Implement the parent module page
4. **Child Modules** - Implement child module pages
5. **Tools** - Create tool components for each child module and assigned them to a Child Module's tab, a tool can be divided by sections which contain closely-related subtools
6. **Core Service Integration** - Integrate relevant core services
7. **Access Control** - Implement permission checks
8. **Testing** - Write appropriate tests
9. **Documentation** - Document the implementation

### Reusable Patterns

The application uses these reusable component patterns:

1. **ParentModuleComponent** - Template for parent module pages
2. **ChildModuleComponent** - Template for child module pages with tabs
3. **ModuleTabs** - Horizontal tab navigation between tools
4. **FormTemplate** - Reusable pattern for forms

### When Assisting Me

- **Explain your reasoning** and architectural decisions
- **Plan implementation** holistically and consider how one file or code piece affects other parts of the code-base
- **Provide imports, exports**, consider type errors and indicate when a library has to be installed
- **Work one file at a time** to gather feeedback before proceeding to the next file
- **Provide complete implementations** rather than snippets
- **Reference existing patterns** in the codebase
- **Be specific about file locations** and imports
- **Anticipate integration points** with core services
- **Consider performance implications** of your suggestions
- **Suggest testing approaches** for new functionality
- **Guide me through complex implementations** step by step
- **Adapt to my feedback** and adjust recommendations accordingly

### Expected Types of Assistance

1. **Architecture and Planning**:
   - Module structure recommendations
   - Data modeling advice
   - Flow diagrams and wireframes

2. **Implementation Guidance**:
   - Complete file implementations
   - Integration with core services
   - Debugging assistance

3. **Code Review and Improvement**:
   - Identifying optimization opportunities
   - Suggesting better patterns
   - Improving type safety

4. **Documentation**:
   - Internal technical documentation
   - User documentation
   - Code commenting suggestions

## Sample Working Session

When I ask for help on a specific module, I'll provide context about:
1. Which parent module it belongs to
2. The purpose of the module
3. Key functionality needed
4. Any specific requirements or constraints

For example:
"I need help implementing the 'Property Evaluations' child module within the 'List Properties' parent module. This module needs to help agents assess property values using comparable properties. It should integrate with the Airtable service for data and the geolocation service for proximity analysis."

Please approach my requests collaboratively, asking clarifying questions when needed, and providing detailed, practical solutions that align with our established architecture and patterns.
