Push updates from 'dev' to 'staging':

    git merge dev
    git push origin staging

Push updates from 'staging' to 'main:

1. Working on new features:
    git checkout -b feature/new-feature

2. Check status:
    git status
    EX:
        Untracked files:
        (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        app/pages/NewFeature.tsx

3. 1. Track specific files:
    git add app/pages/NewFeature.tsx


3. 2. Track all modified and new files:
    git add .

4. Commit (save) changes
    git commit -m "Created NewFeature.tsx - Initial version"

5. 1. Push to Github:
    git push origin dev

5. 2. Push feature branch to Github:
    git push origin feature/new-feature

Merge features back to dev:
    git checkout dev
    git merge feature/new-feature
    git branch -d feature/new-feature
    git push origin dev


Full Git Workflow for a New Feature:
1. git checkout dev                            # Make sure you're in the dev branch
2. git checkout -b feature/new-feature         # (Optional) Create a feature branch
3. Work on the feature (e.g., NewFeature.tsx)  # Create and work on new files
4. git add .                                   # Track all changes
5. git commit -m "Added NewFeature.tsx"        # Save the changes
6. git push origin feature/new-feature         # Upload to GitHub
7. (After testing) Merge into dev:
   - git checkout dev
   - git merge feature/new-feature
   - git push origin dev
8. (Optional) Delete the feature branch:
   - git branch -d feature/new-feature
