# 2.2. Authentication & Authorization Service

## 1. Overview

Our **Authentication & Authorization** service combines **Clerk** user accounts with **Airtable-based** role data to provide a central, **server-side** approach to user identity and permissions. It ensures that:

- We can **merge** roles from Clerk’s public metadata with additional roles stored in Airtable.  
- We have a consistent way to check if a user has a particular **permission** or **module access** using a **role-based** model.  
- Each user’s **profile** (email, name, roles) is accessible via a single `AuthService` class.

## 2. Architecture & Key Concepts

1. **Clerk**  
   - Handles sign-up, sign-in, and session management.  
   - Exposes server-side methods (`auth()` and `clerkClient`) for retrieving user data and metadata.

2. **Airtable**  
   - Optionally stores additional roles (or any other user attributes).  
   - The `AuthService` fetches from an `AirtableService` to merge these roles into a single set.

3. **Permission Service**  
   - Contains a mapping of **roles** to **permissions**.  
   - Checks if a given user’s roles include the permission key requested.

4. **Service Registry**  
   - The `AuthService` registers itself under `auth`.  
   - The `airtable` service is also registered. `AuthService` depends on `airtable` if we need to merge roles from Airtable.

## 3. Folder & File Organization

- **`lib/core-services/auth/authService.ts`**  
  - The main `AuthService` class implementing `ServiceInterface`.  
  - Fetches roles from Clerk **and** Airtable.  
  - Provides `hasPermission` and `hasModuleAccess`.

- **`lib/core-services/auth/permissionService.ts`**  
  - The `PermissionService` with `checkRolePermissions(roles, permissionKey)`.  
  - Imports role–permission mappings from `permissions.ts`.

- **`lib/core-services/auth/permissions.ts`**  
  - Defines the actual **`PERMISSIONS`** constant (e.g., `list-properties:view`)  
  - Defines **`ROLE_PERMISSIONS`** object that maps roles like `admin`, `manager`, `agent` to arrays of permission strings.

- **`types/core-services/auth.ts`**  
  - If needed, stores common types such as `User`, `UserRole`, or any specialized permission types.

- **`app/layout.ts`, `middleware.ts`,** or **`Header.tsx`**  
  - Make use of **`useUser()`** from `@clerk/nextjs` for front-end session checks and user info.  
  - The **AuthService** is purely a **server-side** construct, but you can make an API route or server action that calls `authService.hasPermission(...)`.

## 4. How It Works

### 4.1. Initialization

1. **Service Registry** calls `authService.initialize()`.  
2. `AuthService` tries to retrieve the `airtable` service (if you want to unify roles).  
3. If `airtable` is unavailable, it logs a warning and gracefully proceeds using only Clerk roles.

### 4.2. Fetching the Current User (Server Side)

1. `AuthService.getCurrentUser()` calls `await auth()`, returning the Clerk user ID from the server session.  
2. If no user ID, returns `null`.  
3. Otherwise, calls `clerkClient.users.getUser(userId)` to fetch the user’s profile and `publicMetadata`.  
4. Constructs a local `User` object (id, email, roles, etc.) and returns it.

### 4.3. Merging Roles with Airtable

1. `AuthService.getUserRoles()` also calls `auth()` if you didn’t pass a userId.  
2. It fetches the user from Clerk, extracting `publicMetadata.roles`.  
3. If the `airtableService` is available, it fetches the Airtable record for this user by `ClerkId`.  
4. Merges the two role sets (Clerk + Airtable), removing duplicates.  
5. Returns the final list of role strings.

### 4.4. Checking Permissions

1. `AuthService.hasPermission(permissionKey, userId?)` calls `getUserRoles(userId)` to get the user’s roles.  
2. Instantiates `new PermissionService()`, which references `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`.  
3. `PermissionService` verifies if any role includes that permission key. If the key itself isn’t in `PERMISSIONS`, it returns false.  
4. Returns `true` or `false`.

### 4.5. hasModuleAccess

- If you just want to confirm a user has **any** permission for a module (like `list-properties:view`), you can do `hasModuleAccess(moduleKey, userId)`.  
- Typically, it checks `moduleKey:view` or a default permission.

## 5. Usage Examples

### 5.1. Checking Current User on the Server

```ts
import { authService } from "@/lib/core-services/auth/authService";

export async function someProtectedAction() {
  const user = await authService.getCurrentUser();
  if (!user) {
    throw new Error("Not authenticated!");
  }
  
  console.log("Logged in user:", user.email, "Roles:", user.roles);
  // proceed with action...
}
```

### 5.2. Verifying a Permission

```ts
import { authService } from "@/lib/core-services/auth/authService";

export async function deleteListing(listingId: string) {
  const canDelete = await authService.hasPermission("list-properties:delete");
  if (!canDelete) {
    throw new Error("You do not have permission to delete listings!");
  }

  // ... proceed to delete
}
```

### 5.3. In a Next.js Route

```ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { authService } from "@/lib/core-services/auth/authService";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Make sure 'auth' and 'airtable' are initialized
  // e.g., via an initCoreServices call if needed
  const canCreate = await authService.hasPermission("sell-properties:create");
  if (!canCreate) {
    return new NextResponse("Forbidden", { status: 403 });
  }

  // ... create the property to sell
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
}
```

## 6. Common Pitfalls / Best Practices

1. **Forgetting to Await** `auth()`  
   - `auth()` is async in the new Clerk versions. If you destructure `const { userId } = auth();` without `await`, you’ll get errors or an empty object.

2. **Empty Roles**  
   - If a user hasn’t set `publicMetadata.roles`, you might get an empty array. Ensure you handle the “no roles” scenario gracefully.

3. **Clerk vs. Airtable Conflicts**  
   - If a user has conflicting roles in Clerk vs. Airtable, it merges them. Your code doesn’t handle conflicts automatically—just merges them. Decide how you want to handle that.

4. **Client vs. Server**  
   - This service is primarily **server-side**. On the client, you typically rely on `@clerk/nextjs` hooks like `useUser()` for the session and user data. If you want to do a permission check in the client, you either do a server call or accept some duplication.

5. **Admin vs. Manager**  
   - If your `admin` role includes all permissions, ensure you do `...Object.values(PERMISSIONS).flatMap(...)`. Otherwise, you might miss new permissions.

## 7. Environment & Configuration

- **Clerk**:  
  - Must configure your Clerk app domain, **API keys**, etc.  
  - The `@clerk/nextjs/server` usage requires environment variables or next.config settings.

- **Airtable**:  
  - `AIRTABLE_PAT` (Personal Access Token)  
  - `AIRTABLE_USERS_BASE_ID` and `AIRTABLE_USERS_TABLE_ID` for user–role lookups.  

- **Public Metadata**:  
  - In Clerk, you can store roles in `user.publicMetadata.roles`. Ensure your front-end or sign-up logic sets that field if needed.

## 8. Testing & Validation

- **Unit Tests**  
  - Mock `auth()` and `clerkClient.users.getUser` to simulate users with different roles.  
  - Check that `authService.getUserRoles()` merges roles from clerk and mock Airtable data.

- **Integration Tests**  
  - Spin up a local or test Airtable environment with test user records.  
  - Combine that with the Clerk test keys or mock your environment so you can confirm real merging of roles.

- **API Tests**  
  - For routes that rely on `authService`, test them with different user tokens or sessions to ensure the correct 200 vs. 403 responses.

## 9. Future Improvements

1. **Caching**  
   - Cache `getUserRoles()` results to avoid repeated Airtable calls.  
   - Expire or clear cache when user roles are updated.

2. **More Granular Permissions**  
   - Possibly add domain-specific checks like “edit only your own listing,” which might require more logic than a simple role check.

3. **Auto-Sync**  
   - If you frequently add roles in Airtable, consider automatically pushing them to Clerk or vice versa.

4. **Fine-Grained Access**  
   - Right now, each role is a static set of permissions. In advanced scenarios, you might want dynamic or field-level permissions.

## 10. Conclusion

By consolidating **Clerk** and **Airtable** roles in a single **AuthService**, we get a **unified** approach to user identification and permission checks. It:

- Ensures **consistency**: all modules use the same `hasPermission()` logic.  
- Simplifies dev flow: no ad-hoc calls to Clerk or Airtable in scattered locations.  
- Keeps your system **flexible**: as roles and permissions evolve, you only need to adjust `permissions.ts` and the `AuthService`.

Use this **Authentication & Authorization** system as a foundation for secure, role-based functionality across your Real Estate Command Center.
