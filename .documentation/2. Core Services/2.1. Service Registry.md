# 2.1. Service Registry

## Overview

The **Service Registry** is a central mechanism in our Real Estate Command Center (RECC) architecture for:

1. **Managing the lifecycle** of all core services (e.g., Cache, Airtable, Auth).
2. **Enforcing initialization order** based on explicit service dependencies.
3. **Providing a single source of truth** to access any service in the app.

By defining each service’s dependencies, the registry ensures that if Service B depends on Service A, then Service A is initialized *before* Service B is used. This prevents circular dependencies and reduces bootstrapping errors.

---

## Key Concepts

1. **`ServiceType`**  
   - A union type (e.g., `'cache' | 'airtable' | 'auth' | 'dam' | 'email' | 'notifications'`) representing all recognized core services in the system.

2. **`ServiceInterface`**  
   - The base interface that all core services must implement (with an `initialize(): Promise<void>` method).
   - This ensures a consistent lifecycle and initialization pattern across services.

3. **Dependencies**  
   - A simple mapping (`Record<ServiceType, ServiceType[]>`) that defines which services must be initialized first. For example:
     ```ts
     {
       cache: [],
       airtable: ['cache'],
       auth: [],
       dam: ['airtable', 'cache'],
       email: ['airtable'],
       notifications: ['airtable', 'cache']
     }
     ```
   - The registry recursively initializes dependencies, ensuring no service is used until all required services are ready.

4. **Aggregator & Service Loader**  
   - **Aggregator (`index.ts`):**  
     A single entry point that imports all core service files so their registration code runs automatically. This ensures every service (e.g., Cache, Airtable, Auth) is registered in the registry before any module attempts to access it.
   - **Service Loader (`serviceLoader.ts`):**  
     A convenience utility that accepts an array of service keys (e.g., `['cache', 'airtable']`) and calls the registry’s `initializeService()` method for each. This guarantees that all required services are fully initialized prior to use.

---

## Folder & File Organization

Within `lib/core-services/`, the key files include:

- **`service-registry.ts`**  
  Contains the `ServiceRegistry` class, which stores service instances, tracks initialization states, and enforces dependencies.
- **`types/core-services/serviceRegistry.ts`**  
  Houses shared type definitions (`ServiceType`, `ServiceInterface`).
- **`serviceLoader.ts`**  
  Provides the `initCoreServices` helper function to initialize a set of services at module load time.
- **`index.ts`** (Aggregator)  
  Imports each individual service file (e.g., `cacheService.ts`, `airtableService.ts`, `authService.ts`) so that their registration code executes automatically.

As your system grows, you can expand the aggregator file to include new core services. This centralizes service registration and makes it easy to see all core services in one place.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Registering a Service

- **Each service file** (e.g., `cacheService.ts`) creates its service instance and registers it by calling:
  ```ts
  serviceRegistry.register('cache', cacheService);
  ```
- This registration stores the instance in the registry’s internal `Map<ServiceType, ServiceInterface>`.

### 2. Initializing a Service

- When a module calls `serviceRegistry.getService('cache')`, the registry:
  1. Checks if the service is already registered.
  2. If not yet initialized, it calls `initializeService('cache')`, which:
     - Recursively initializes dependencies (e.g., Airtable depends on Cache).
     - Calls the service’s own `initialize()` method.
     - Marks the service as initialized.
  3. Returns the fully initialized service instance.

### 3. Using `initCoreServices`

- The **`initCoreServices`** function in `serviceLoader.ts` allows grouped initialization:
  ```ts
  await initCoreServices(['cache', 'airtable', 'auth']);
  ```
- This ensures that when a module or API route starts up, all required services are ready for use.

### 4. Aggregator File (`index.ts`)

- The aggregator file imports all service files (e.g., `import "./cache/cacheService"`) so their registration code runs.
- This guarantees that the registry is populated with every core service before any module or route requests one.

## Typical Usage Pattern

### 1. In Each Service File

```ts
// lib/core-services/cache/cacheService.ts
import { serviceRegistry } from "../service-registry";
import { ServiceInterface } from "@/types/core-services/serviceRegistry";

export class CacheService implements ServiceInterface {
  async initialize(): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic (e.g., ping Redis)
  }
  // Additional methods (get, set, del, etc.)
}

const cacheService = new CacheService();
serviceRegistry.register("cache", cacheService);
export { cacheService };
```

### 2. In Your Application Modules

```ts
// e.g., pages/api/loadData.ts
import { initCoreServices } from "@/lib/core-services/serviceLoader";
import { serviceRegistry } from "@/lib/core-services/service-registry";

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    // Ensure required services are initialized
    await initCoreServices(["cache", "airtable"]);

    const cache = await serviceRegistry.getService("cache");
    const airtable = await serviceRegistry.getService("airtable");

    // Use the services as needed...
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle initialization errors
  }
}
```

### 3. Using `serviceLoader.ts`

- **Group Initialization:**  
  For modules needing multiple services, call:
  ```ts
  await initCoreServices(['cache', 'airtable']);
  ```
  This centralizes the initialization process and avoids repetitive code.

- **Error Handling:**  
  If any service fails to initialize, the entire call throws an error—ensuring no module starts in a partially initialized state.

## Expanding the Aggregator File

### When to Expand

- **Adding New Core Services:**  
  When you create a new service (e.g., DAM, Email, Notifications), add its import to the aggregator.
- **Modifying Service Dependencies:**  
  Update both the aggregator file and the dependency map in `service-registry.ts` as necessary.
- **Conditional or Lazy Loading:**  
  For performance or environment-specific reasons, you might adjust the aggregator to conditionally import certain services.

### Why Expand

- **Centralized Registration:**  
  The aggregator ensures every core service’s registration code executes, preventing “Service not registered” errors.
- **Maintainability:**  
  A single file listing all services simplifies code review and updates.
- **Scalability:**  
  As your application grows, simply add an import for each new service and update the dependency map.

### How to Expand

1. **Open `lib/core-services/index.ts`.**
2. **Add an Import Statement for the New Service:**  
   For example, if you add DAM:
   ```ts
   import "./dam/damService"; // registers 'dam'
   ```
3. **Update the Dependency Map:**  
   Modify `service-registry.ts` if the new service has dependencies.
4. **Verify Registration:**  
   Check your console logs for a message like `Service 'dam' registered`.

## Benefits

- **Clarity of Dependencies:**  
  Services clearly declare their dependencies, and the registry enforces initialization order.
- **Consistency:**  
  Using `getService` ensures that developers always retrieve the same singleton instance.
- **Isolation & Scalability:**  
  Each service can be tested in isolation, and new services are easily added.
- **Convenience:**  
  The combination of the aggregator and `initCoreServices` provides a clean and centralized initialization process.

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Forgetting to Register a Service:**  
   If a service file isn’t imported in the aggregator, its registration code won’t run, causing `getService('X')` to fail.
2. **Circular Dependencies:**  
   Avoid dependencies that loop back on each other. This can lead to infinite recursion.
3. **Not Handling Initialization Errors:**  
   If a service fails during initialization, decide whether to fail fast or handle it gracefully.

---

## Conclusion

The **Service Registry** is a cornerstone of the RECC architecture. By systematically registering services, defining dependencies, and providing a single access point via `getService`, the registry offers a **clean, scalable, and maintainable** approach to managing core services.

The addition of the **aggregator file** (`index.ts`) and the **service loader** (`serviceLoader.ts`) further streamlines initialization:
- **Aggregator (`index.ts`):** Automatically imports and registers all core service files.
- **Service Loader (`serviceLoader.ts`):** Offers a convenience layer to initialize groups of services at once.

When new core services are added, simply update the aggregator file and dependency map. This ensures your application remains organized, scalable, and predictable, making it easier to maintain as it grows.
