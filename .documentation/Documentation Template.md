# Service/Module Name

## 1. Overview

- **Purpose**: Summarize the primary purpose of this service or module.  
- **Context**: Briefly mention how it fits into the larger system.  
- **Key Benefits**: One or two sentences explaining why we built it and what problem it solves.

## 2. Architecture & Key Concepts

- **Core Components**: If there are multiple classes/files, list them here (e.g., `Service Class`, `Helper Utilities`, etc.).  
- **Dependencies**: Any required external services or libraries (e.g., Redis, AWS).  
- **Data Flow**: A short description of how data flows in or out (optional diagram if helpful).
- **Integration**:
  - **Service Registry**: How this service registers and depends on other services
  - **Other Core Services**: If it calls or is called by Airtable, Auth, etc.
  - **UI/Modules**: Typical usage in modules or routes

## 3. Folder & File Organization

- **Location**: Indicate where to find this service in the repo (e.g., `lib/core-services/notification`).  
- **Subfolders**: If it has multiple subfolders (`hooks`, `utils`, etc.), mention what each contains.  
- **Important Files**: List the main files and a short note on their purpose.

## 4. How It Works

- **Initialization**: If applicable, describe how the service initializes (e.g., `initialize()` method, environment variables, etc.).  
- **Runtime Behavior**: Summarize typical operations (e.g., “fetch data from Airtable,” “store objects in Redis,” “send emails via SendGrid”).  
- **Methods/Endpoints**: If relevant, list the public methods or endpoints with a brief “what each does.”

## 5. Usage Examples

1. **Basic Example**  
   ```ts
   // Show how a developer would typically call this service
   await service.someMethod();
   ```
2. **Advanced Example** (Optional)  
   ```ts
   // Show a more advanced or specialized usage scenario
   await service.anotherMethod({ option: true });
   ```

## 6. Common Pitfalls / Best Practices

- **Common Pitfalls**: e.g., forgetting to initialize the service, incorrectly setting environment variables, handling edge cases, etc.  
- **Best Practices**: e.g., recommended TTL defaults, how to handle exceptions, how to do caching, etc.

## 7. Environment Variables & Configuration

- **Relevant Variables**: e.g. `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID`, etc.  
- **Where Set**: mention `.env` or other config file.  
- **Notes/Constraints**: e.g., “must be https,” “string must be base64-encoded,” etc.

## 8. Testing & Validation

- **Test Suites**: Summarize existing unit, integration, or end-to-end tests.  
- **Mocking**: If there’s a recommended way to mock external APIs or third-party libraries in tests, note it here.  
- **Known Limitations**: If something’s not fully tested or corner cases exist, document them.

## 9. Future Improvements

- **Planned Upgrades**: e.g., “Add keepTtl support,” “Handle partial outages more gracefully,” “Refactor for multi-region.”  
- **Feature Requests**: If relevant, mention new functionality the team might implement soon.

## 10. Conclusion

- **Summary**: Reiterate how this service helps the overall system and what developers should keep in mind when using it.  
- **Reference Links** (Optional): e.g., official docs for external APIs, architecture diagrams, Slack channel for discussion, etc.

### Why Use This Template?

- **Consistency**: Every service’s docs have the same sections, making it easy for new devs to find relevant info.  
- **Complete Coverage**: It ensures you don’t forget to document environment variables, testing strategy, or common pitfalls.  
- **Scalability**: As your project grows, this structure keeps docs from becoming ad hoc or disorganized.

Use or adapt this template for each of your core services, modules, or major features. By following a common structure, you promote a **shared, predictable** development experience.
